# Motivation


The University of Toronto is a huge university with three campuses and over 15000 students. The university provides a vibrant and diverse student community, with hundreds of clubs, academic departments, and external organizations regularly hosting events such as workshops, sporting activities, networking events and career fairs. Although the University of Toronto provides an open and fascinating university life, not all students will have the chance to attend or notice the events they are interested in. Students often struggle to stay informed because event information is **scattered across multiple disconnected platforms**. Each faculty or organization tends to maintain its own communication channel, resulting in **poor cross-departmental coordination**.  Although there are some current solutions to integrate these event information to enhance cross-departmental coordination, such as Quercus announcements and social media for departments and external organizations, these solutions have significant shortcomings. Quercus emails rarely contain information about events and activities from external organizations, while social media doesn't have exclusive notification systems for the students, which leads them to have a hard time following up with the event and activity information. 

To provide students with a better university experience, the team decided to build an **all-in-one software** that will integrate all the events and activity information together. The proposed solution, **uConnect,**  is a **React-Native based software** designed to **bridge communication gaps and centralize event** **information across the University of Toronto community**, aiming to minimize these communication gaps by developing a centralized mobile platform that will make it easy for any student to find all the events and activities at the University of Toronto in an all-in-one platform. 

The target users of this application can be categorized into two main groups: **students** and **organizations**. For **student users**, the application serves as a centralized hub that simplifies the process of event discovery and participation. Students will have the ability to **browse** through various campus events, workshops, and activities across different departments and clubs. They can **register** for events directly through the application and **receive notifications** about upcoming opportunities that align with their interests. For **organizational users**, including student clubs, external organizations, and departmental event organizers, the platform provides a comprehensive management system to handle all aspects of event administration. Organizations can **create, update, and delete events**, inspect participant lists, and **send notifications or reminders** to registered students. 

By implementing these key features and advanced functionalities, the team aims to transform **uConnect** into a **dynamic and engaging platform** that strengthens the University of Toronto’s academic and social ecosystem. The platform will centralize event discovery, enhance participation, and encourage collaboration among student organizations, making it easier for students to stay connected with campus life. **UConnect** hopes to create a **vibrant and inclusive university community**, empowering both students and organizations to actively contribute to a more connected and meaningful campus experience.

# Objective & Key Features

The proposed application, **uConnect**, aims to establish a **centralized hub for campus events and activities** that integrates all kinds of UofT(University of Toronto)-related events, activities, and opportunities from various organizations into a single mobile platform. This application will serve as the **primary access point** for students and organizers to discover, manage, and participate in university-wide events, reducing the excessive event information spread across multiple platforms. With a proper user-authentication process, authorized student users for the mobile application will be able to **browse, register, and engage** in event-related discussions, promoting **social participation and collaboration** across various departments or faculties.

In addition to the student users, authorized event organizers will have access to a dedicated management interface that enables them to **create, update, and monitor** events efficiently, ensuring all listings remain accurate and up to date. This management system will also provide visibility into participant engagement and event performance, allowing organizers to make informed decisions and improve future event planning.

Furthermore, uConnect seeks to **enhance user experience and motivation** by constructing a more interactive and inclusive event environment. By prioritizing accessibility, personalization, and engagement, users are allowed to easily discover events aligned with their interests and participate through a user-friendly and intuitive interface. By promoting sustained engagement and rewarding active participation, the application ensures to **create a connected, dynamic, and collaborative campus culture.**<br>

| Objective | Key Features | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Centralize campus events and activities | Implement Navigation Structure by using Expo Router | Constructing a file-based multi-screen interface structured under the Expo Router system, with routes for various pages in the application. The navigation flow is managed through folder and layout organization within the /app directory, where each page file is stored, ensuring smooth transitions and a consistent screen hierarchy. Under the /app directory, there will be at least five screens: **Home Screen:** Displays all current and upcoming campus events in a scrollable feed. **Event Details Screen:** Shows event title, date, time, location, description, organizer info, and event photos. **Calendar Screen:** Displays all events the user has registered for, with reminder notifications. **Account Screen:** Displays user profile, badges, and participation history. (For organizers only) **Manage Events Screen:** Create and edit events, view participation stats. |
|  | Backend Integration by BaaS platform Supabase | Supabase provides a hosted PostgreSQL database with built-in REST APIs, authentication. The app fetches and displays live event data through API calls, ensuring dynamic UI updates and smooth navigation using Expo Router’s route parameters. |
| Encourage social engagement and participation | Implement local notification systems by Expo Notifications.  | Constructing a local notification system using Expo Notifications to deliver timely reminders about upcoming events and updates to modified event details. Notifications enable users to access specific event pages directly, enhancing engagement and ensuring they stay informed about relevant campus activities. |
|  | Ensuring notifications when Uconnect is closed or backgrounded | Applying Supabase Realtime and Edge Functions for triggering remote push notifications when event data changes, ensuring that users receive up-to-date alerts through the Expo Notifications system when the app is backgrounded or closed. (Advanced feature) |
| Empower event organizers with management tools | Manage Events Screen | Provides organizers with access to create, edit, and monitor events, including viewing participant statistics and engagement metrics. |
|  | User Authentication | Implements secure role-based access for both students and organizers, managing login sessions and permissions persistently. |
| Enhance user experience and motivation | (Optional)Gamification System | Introduces a badge and points-based system that rewards both students and organizers for consistent event participation and hosting. Displays achievements on user profiles. |
|  | State Management and Persistence using Redux toolkit and persistent data storage by React Native Async Storage. | Ensures consistent app-wide data handling for user roles, authentication status, and event participation across sessions, providing a seamless and personalized user experience. Implements persistent storage to securely retain and update user information each time a user logs in to the application. |
|  | (Optional) Accessibility Enhancements with screen reader support. | Supports to ensure inclusive usability for all users. Accessibility features are implemented using React Native’s built-in accessibility APIs to provide clear semantic descriptions of interface elements. In addition to standard accessibility configurations, an **advanced implementation introduces enhanced support for screen readers**, ensuring accurate focus order, content descriptions, and real-time feedback across all screens. The system also supports high-contrast mode to improve visual clarity and readability.  |
|  | Deployment using **Expo EAS Build** | Utilizes **Expo EAS Build** to generate production-ready builds for both Android and iOS platforms. This approach ensures consistent build configuration and seamless integration with the Expo ecosystem. The resulting application packages are delivered as testable artifacts, enabling efficient testing on emulators and physical devices.
